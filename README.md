# Run and deploy your AI Studio app

This contains everything you need to run your app locally.

View your app in AI Studio: https://ai.studio/apps/drive/1hOl2nbXGiDyEnkjOALIWWM3VlndX1bXN

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js


1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in [.env.local](.env.local) to your Gemini API key
3. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`


   ( Note: I gave the Gemini instance minimal direction, only a couple small color tweaks from AI art found on a google search. I wanted to see what it would do. It made the rest of the  coding and visual choices. Feel free to explore it more. It's genuinely terrible.)
